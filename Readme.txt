This is an unofficial modification of Emblem Kings, a Crusader Kings 2 
modification originally created by Balk_J of the Paradox Forums.
The last version of the mod, 0.16.2, was released for 3.0.1.1, and the last 
stable version was 0.15, for 2.8.2. With the current version of CK2 being at
3.2.1, I decided to try to update the mod a bit and fix some issues.
Most of the changes are focused on Jugdral as it is my personal favourite.
Magvel is still in a heavily WIP state and Tellius is not implemented.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Copy the "Emblem Kings Edits" folder and .mod file from the zip you downloaded
this in. The mod should appear in the launched as "Emblem Kings - Edited
Version". This is to contrast it with the official version.
If you want to use the portrait submod, repeat the procedure for that.
Note that the Monks and Mystics DLC is required for this submod, as it is
based on the German portraits of the vanilla game.

UNOFFICIAL V0.17 CHANGELOG:
*Compatibility with CK2 3.2 Iron Century.
*Bloodlines added for descendants of the Twelve Crusaders. These work in tandem
with the pre-existing traits, with the bloodline based off perceptions while
the traits determine the reality of things. Bonuses have been split as
appropriate.
*Gave fixed stats to many characters in the FE4 and FE5 bookmarks. Playable
characters and major bosses will now be consistend from playthrough to play-
through. In particular, Sigurd should now more consistently defeat Verdane.
*Artifacts and classes have had their personal combat scores adjusted to
match post-Holy Fury levels. 
*Many dynasties in Elibe had broken family trees due to not being connected to
their pre-generated ancestors. These connections have been made, fixing the
issue, and making their family trees functional.
*Fixed several province border errors scattered around the world.
*Random/Shattered Worlds no longer crash the game. They have not been fine-
tuned and placeholder real-world religions will often appear.
*Game rules up to Iron Century have been included.
*A bug in Sigurd's plot events causing the Duchy of Chalphy to be destroyed and
demoting him to count rank after the Verdane invasion has been fixed.
(A side note: the king often gave him the title back in playtesting.)
*A recent version of the mod changed "e_loptyr" to "e_loptous", but many events
had not been updated to accomodate this change. These have been updated,
restoring the ability to form the empire.
*The Manster Resistance should no longer form in the FE5 and FE4 Gen 2
bookmarks where the title already exists, generating a new ruler in place of
its canonical one and breaking the scripted wars.
*Most kingdoms in the mod required the character to be the liege of the
current king to usurp them. However, this caused issues in the case of
there not being a king, as it required the player to have "No Character" as a
liege. Now the player's primary title must be under the title that must be
formed, as I believe that was the intent of the restriction.
*The Valega religion has been haphazardly assigned holy sites, corresponding
to places Myrrh showed up and did things in.
*The Featured Ruler tab no longer has a blank ledger window at the bottom.

KNOWN ISSUES:
*Some recommended characters cannot be played, as they are landless. Lyn in the
FE7 Lyn Mode bookmark and Sety in the FE5 bookmark are two I know of.
*Magvel is still a shattered world with no characters defined yet.
*Some secret cult events may cause issues when preparing ground.
*Holy Fury duels appear to have displaced the previous Game of Thrones duels.
*Immersion-breaking real-world references occasionally appear in events.
*Bloodline icons are placeholders and the descriptions are bad
*Random bits of localisations end up disappearing at times
